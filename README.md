##ACCIDENT DETECTION
In modern societies one of the main factors that increases mortalities is Traffic accidents. Everyday a large number of human lives are lost due to accidents and delay in calling the rescue services. Therefore, the elimination of delay in rescuing traffic accidents victims is very important and needs to be addressed extensively. With the rapid developments in embedded systems, GPS and mobile communications, it is becoming possible to develop an in-vehicle automatic accident and theft detection and reporting systems. Such systems utilize sensors provided in the vehicle and mobile communication systems to report the location of the vehicle in the case of accident or theft. In this paper an efficient system that automatically notifies the emergency and police services about the accident or the theft and also guides them to the spot. In the case of accident the system detect the event by the Crash Sensor of the Air Bag System installed in the vehicle. If these observations are above a preset critical point, a controller triggers a message to notify the Emergency Services. While theft detection is performed by sensing the existence of Datatag Car System. For both cases the system obtains the location of the vehicle by a GPS receiver and send SMS through GSM/GPRS system.
